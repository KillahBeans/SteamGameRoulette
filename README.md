This program will attempt to go through your Steam game directory and randomly choose a game there.
The program will attempt to find and read the "steam_appid.txt" text file which will provide the game ID needed to run the game. 
In the event that the program in unable to find the game's ID, you will have the option of manually inserting the game ID by finding it through the site, "https://steamdb.info/search/"
Once the id is found and has been copy and pasted, the game will be ran.
